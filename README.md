# Social Network API

## Description

This project was built with the intent to provide an API for a social network web application where users can have a list of friends and be able to share their thoughts with friends as well as react to other friends' thoughts. For the meantime, this project serves as the backend portion to the app.  

## Installation

If you have not done so, you can download [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and install [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download) to your computer in order to use the app.

## Usage

You can download the application and from the directory open up a terminal within Visual Studio Code. On the terminal, you can start by running the command `npm i`. After the install, you can run the command `node server.js` to start the server. The server should run on PORT 3001 so on Insomnia you can run API requests with `localhost:3001`. A video will be provided detailing the functionality of the application.
